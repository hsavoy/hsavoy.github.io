I’m currently working on my PhD at UC Berkeley in the [Civil and Environmental Engineering department](http://www.ce.berkeley.edu) with a [Designated Emphasis in Computational Data Science and Engineering](http://citris-uc.org/decse-mission/). I received my M.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Berkeley as well in 2013 and before that I attended the [Florida Institute of Technology](http://coe.fit.edu/dmes/) where I got my B.S. in Environmental Science with a minor in Computational Mathematics in 2012.

I’m originally from rural Florida where groundwater is an important resource and this background has shaped my research interests.
