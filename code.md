# MAD&#35;
I’m part of the development team for MAD&#35;, an open-source Uncertainty Characterization Framework software that implements the Method of Anchored Distributions (MAD). See our [Codeplex site](http://mad.codeplex.com) or my Publications page for references. 


# anchoredDistr
I’m currently working on submitting a package for R for post-processing results from MAD&#35; to CRAN. It is currently hosted on [Github](https://hsavoy.github.io/anchoredDistr/).

# shiny
I’ve recently started to experiment with shiny and made a [small demonstration](https://hsavoy.shinyapps.io/Correlation_Regression/) for a lecture I gave on correlation and linear regression.
