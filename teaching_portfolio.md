I’m currently a fellow at UC Berkeley’s Summer Institute for Preparing Future Faculty in which I will create a teaching portfolio. I’ll upload it when I’m done! Until then, here are the highlights:

* I was a teaching assistant for Engineering Data Analysis (sophomore-level probability and statistics for engineers) for the Spring 2016 semester at UC Berkeley. I was responsible for creating assignments, hosting office hours (4 hrs/wk), and answering questions on our Piazza site. I also substituted for three one-hour lectures during the semester. I really enjoyed the experience and look forward to teaching a similar class one day.

* I have also volunteered for the UC Berkeley Civil and Environmental Engineering Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program from June 2015 until the present. I have been working with an undergraduate student on my [dimension reduction project](site.permalink: /current_projects).
